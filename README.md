# applicationlearning
An exercise to learn how to build an application

Note:

To run the application is necessary to have Apache Tomcat and the MySQL connector drive in the project.

Apache Tomcat version: 8.5.86
https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/

MySQL Connector Drive version: 8.0.17
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 

You probably will have to change your connection URL too in the Controller Servlet.   
URL used: jdbc:mysql://localhost:{port}/{databasename}?useTimezone=true&serverTimezone=UTC
